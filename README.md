# Customer-Satisfaction-ml-project-
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction using real-world structured data. The goal is to analyze key features like service quality, response time, product usage, and customer profile, and then use ML models to classify customer satisfaction into multiple levels.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Age
- Product Purchased
- Type of Issue
- Response Time
- Customer Feedback
- Service Rating (Target Variable)

## Steps Followed:
1. *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing* – Handle null values, correct data types, and remove outliers
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Understand feature relationships using graphs and statistics
3. *Feature Engineering– Encode categorical features, scale numerical ones
4. 4. *Model Building* – Trained models like RandomForest, Logistic Regression
5. *Evaluation* – Used accuracy score, confusion matrix for model evaluation
6. *Conclusion* – Highlighted best performing model and business use-case insights

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
